<p>Take a look at this graph. This is perfect explanation on why I hear a lot of very young people, starting in industry ( Gamedev here, but applies to many other areas of life/business ), either evaluating work for impossible low hour-budgets, or taking waaay to complex tasks on themselves, only to fail miserably.</p>
<p><em>It's very hard for people to evaluate something correctly, even their own experience, without the experience itself.</em></p>
<p>And thats why I trust more a person who approach a task carefully with budget buffers, rather than confident people who spent too much time convincing me everything will be amazing.</p>

                <p>Long story short, I wanted to power raspberry pi through unused sata connector / bay in my thinkpad. However, it acted dead every time I've tried, with wired connector orsoldered power pins.</p>

<p>Turned out, for my thinkpads (and most likely all devices that have slimline SATA connector) to start providing power, we need to fake the presence of the device.</p>
<p>I've found that after doing some digging around documentation on google books here: <a href="https://books.google.pl/books?id=PqvNBQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA355&amp;lpg=PA355&amp;dq=sata+device+presence+ground&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=E4RrIA9nLR&amp;sig=ACfU3U05Pm94MDOFm3K33Ni6BZG6LoowfQ&amp;hl=pl&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwir_dTT-vjjAhXhs4sKHQEkDugQ6AEwE3oECBEQAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=sata%20device%20presence%20ground&amp;f=false">[ The Essential Guide to Serial ATA and SATA Express, Page 355, Table 8.2 ]</a> and Wikipedia: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serial_ATA#Slimline_connector">[ Serial Ata: Slimline Connector ]</a> I needed to bridge first and last ( or second to last, or 5 / 6 ) pin together with resistor of 0-220ohm resistance.</p>

<p>Worth remembering. Build log of my multibay-mounted raspberry pi soon, when I get rest of the components.</p>

                <p>It's rain wet streets. It's nights like this with fog rolling in. Cars, faceless people going by, doing the things that they are doing. There's something kinds hypnotic about it. That's when I get inspired. To carry what these streets are like, what the city is like. The mistery, the stories, the thousands of thousands of people that you pass, that they are going by in shadows. In this wet, cold, dangerous environment.</p>
