            "content_html": "<p>AKA - how much should I ask for doing XYZ?</p>\n<p>First thing I want to say: If youre good at something, never do it for free -If you do it for free, youre an exploitable idiot, and youre not only hurting yourself, but the industry itself. Im not talking about free modding or community projects - I'm talking about getting exploited for \"exposure\" or \"future business ventures\", \"royalties\" etc. Just don't,.</p>\n<p>There are two ways I can answer that, short and long.</p>\n<p>Short answer:</p>\n<p><strong>TIME YOU SPENT DOING THE WORK x HOW MUCH YOU CHARGE PER HOUR</strong></p>\n<p><em>(Client dont always need to know how long it'll take you, sometimes they dont care - it all depends on the job really, but you should always know these two values - how long and how much)</em></p>\n<p>Thats it, easy. However, it works when you remotely know how expensive life is, but if you've been linked this post, most of you probably don't, or don't know what to include in expenses when freelancing, so here comes the long answer:</p>\n<p><strong>TIME SPENT DOING THE WORK</strong> x <strong>(Hourly rate + financial buffor + equipment cost/wear buffor + software + power cost/internet cost + taxes + additional factors)</strong></p>\n<p>Let me describe what means what:</p>\n<p><strong>Time spent doing the work</strong> - you need to know how long you'll work on the asset - 5 hours? 50 hours? If you agree to make a gun model, because OH WOW ITS REMOTE WORK I LOVE DOIN 3D AND SOMEONE WILL PAY FOR IT! - I understand, its cool, we've been there. However, if you agree to make a gun model for 200usd, and it'll take you 80 hours (and remember there might be additional feedback / issues at the end, more about it later), Its suddenly 200usd divided by 80 hours of your time, which equals to nice... 2,5 USD per hour. Depending where you live, you might get more working at McDonalds, so the choice is yours. This is the reasons you see professionals charging up people for thousands of dollars for one AAA model - not because they're assholes, but because work takes time, and time is everything. You have 24hours in a day, I have 24hours in a day, so does the client.</p>\n<p> <strong>Hourly rate</strong> - hardest thing to estimate here, because it depends on how niche the thing youre doing is, how large is the competition in area youre working now, and how much people of your skill level are out there. It is not rare to see Juniors working for 15usd/h remotely, middle artists for 15-30usd/h, and seniors for 30+ (Personally I know people who charge 120usd per hour of their time - it seems a lot, but like with everything - there is a catch). This is the value you'd want to earn working in a studio, or on-site work.</p>\n<p><strong>Financial buffor </strong>- this is where extra stuff starts. Ok, you have a self-employment company, or just remote working for some client on a contract-based work (it strongly depends on the country you work IN and FOR, its your responsibility to check all the formalities) - if you're lucky, you have constant flow of work, 40,50,60hours per week, paid on hourly basis - and thats great. However, there is always possiblity, that the work will go dry, there will be one month pause between projects - what then? Exactly, your financial buffor. Depending how expensive your area is, its good to have SOME savings, for me its usually calculated in a way that for working 3 months, I can live 1 month without work (so spending 3 hours of work, you charge like for 4 hours). And try to save up this money, don't spent it on videogames,whores or whisky. At least try not to. </p>\n<p><strong>Equipment cost/wear</strong> - if you're young, and do work on a computer you have from the college times, and always had one, then its probably weird for you, but if your source income is actual freelancing/contract work, its VERY IMPORTANT to be able to do the work. The more complex work you do, the more powerfull machine you need. Now imagine you just got a contract with 2 week deadline for a model, and on second day your PC dies. You waste time for debugging what happened, waste time for looking for parts, waste time waiting for parts to arrive, wasting time recovering the work you had opened (you have backups in case harddrive fails, right? :-) ). And  thats if you have money for new hardware. If you don't, youre screwed - sometimes a cheap laptop CAN DO JUST ENOUGH, but with more complex tasks, its mandatory to have a higher perfomance hardware. After 15 years in the field, I have ready-to-use secondary workstation that have almost identical parameters as my main one, + few server rackable computers with backups / rendering possibilities. In big corporate world its called hardware resource scaling, and after some time, its good to have money to do it as well.</p>\n<p><strong>Software - </strong>if you pirate your software, we wont be friends. And youre probably limiting yourself to clients who pay less than a fast-food joint, so its your loss as well. Software costs a lot. Now its hidden under \"subscription\" pricing model, but after a year or two, you start losing money on it. Its just 100usd monthly, but normal licence cost 3000 usd, so after 3 years, youre paying extra. But have updates, thats a trade-off. Most of my game-dev work CAN and IS done on... 3d Studio max 2012. Why? Because I have lifetime licence for it, costed me around 2000USD. Its 2020, and 3ds max cost 300usd/mo in my country, co after 7 months, i'd start paying extra, for rest of the 8 years. HOWEVER - I'm drifting off here, just wanted to show the alternatives - software (unless blender) costs as well, and if you work on game models, you probably want at least 3d modelling package + texturing package. So keep it in mind that you need to incorporate the cost into hour price as well (assuming you work 200h/monthly, you can add 2usd to hourly rate, and you'll have 400usd for software - not counting initial windows licence cost, it should be enough for monthly subscriptions + a plugin or two monthly.</p>\n<p><strong>Power cost/internet cost - </strong>Thats the funny one, because its often ignored. Unless you work just on models and textures, on a laptop (You should get workstation though), it won't affect you much. However, if you do renders / simulations / CUDA calculations, it might affect your monthly bills a lot - I had contract where I had to render multiple versions of lightmaps for unity game, and it turned out in 20 days I've used 1200% more energy that I've used previous month in total. And I needed to pay for every kilowatt spent anyway. With internet it really depends on the work you do - if you work on movies/raws, there is a lot of data to be transferred SOMEWHERE, and you don't want to miss deadlines, because you had 60kbps transfer to clients server - thats why a good connection (not only in download speeds, but upload speeds) is a must. Or two of them. I have 1 connection to my home + one backup LTE router if it fails, but I plan on getting second wired one, as projects sometimes hits 100GBs of data that need to be transferred.</p>\n<p><strong>Taxes - </strong>welcome to the adult world. Everything you earn, is taxed. Depending on your country, it can be 9,5%, it can be 22%, it can be 39% - we wont discuss how fair or not it is, but you better pay these taxes, or IRS (or local equivalent of it) at some point will make your life hell. Dont worry, clients (if its a company, not some backward savage garage-based venture) know that, and if they don't employ you on normal contract, but outsource work, don't pay the expenses, and should be ready for you charging more than on-sire normal employment. If freelancing is your way of living, I strongly suggest hiring an accountant as I do, to take care about all the taxation purgatory.</p>\n<p>Which brings me to last point:</p>\n<p> <strong>Additional factors -</strong> just like that accountant I've mentioned before, there is a lot of things related to your work, that cost money. Im not talking about rent or food, but things like office costs, cabs, alcohol, website domain/server if you have business website, some small marketing even. New plugins, tutorials, resources - if you can pay 5 dollars for a pack of decals you'd spent 4 days making, just buy the decals. It'll depend strongly on where you are at the career path.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>",

Most of my custom tools that help me speed up my workflow are in 2012 though, and i dont use any particular features that are NOT in 2012 that'd force me to use newer version. Why I'm not upgrading? Because subscription model, at least by the time of writing this post, is quite expensive, and after 3 years I'd spent same money I've spent on 2012, and its almost 2020, so I'd lose triple amount of money. Anyway.<br>Assuming you have all the refs you need and few more, start modelling:<br>Blockout phase, LP phase are done in 3DS Max. Blockout phase, sometimes called \"basemesh\" phase when it's quite dense, but doesnt have clean topology, I'm trying to keep it in quads anyway for easier of work later. Looptool/Swift loop is your friend, when you'll be making edges around the borders to protect them when you sub-d later.<br><br>Having a basemesh that have well defined details that I'd see on LP geometry, and have a proportions that match the references / desired model, I'm making a copy of it and start working on high poly (HP from now). I use sub-d modelling exclusively, nowadays workflows like to include zbrush/dynamesh/proboolean workflow, its ok when the time is tight and you need to quickly have some results. However, it teaches practically nothing about controlling topology and flow of the geometry, so a good practice is to use sub-d whenever you can, and only half-ass meshes in zbrush when youre in a hurry and client dont care.<br><br>Ok, now that half of the people got offended and stopped reading, the HP I end up with have all the details on geometry, with the exceptions like diamond patterns on grips or fabric weave that can be easily made on texture itself. I do model sometimes braided cables / more complex diamond patterns when the surface they're on is curved, but its usually pain.<br><br>With HP done, I go back to my basemesh, that now should overlap with the finished high poly pretty tight. Duplicating it, this will be my low-poly mesh. Im deleting uneccessary edges / division, making the basemesh truly lowpoly, yet detailed enough to bake properly (rules for certain types of objects still apply - where to put denser geo, what chamfer and what not, depending on where the camera looks, et cetera). Now the magical part that streamlines unwrapping by 80% of time. I set up automatic smoothgroups by 33-45degrees, having most if not all hard edges well defined on low poly, The i apply unwrap UVW modifier, and use one nifty function - uv chunks by smoothgroups, that creates uv islands based off your smoothgroups. Only thing you need to manually cut are cylinders, that need to be cut on one edge to unwrap properly. After all the pieces are done, I use quick peel, relax, and have quite good, relaxed UVs. <br><br><em>The poor mans UV version, using 3ds max:</em><br><em>Ok, now you'll need some automation, unless you want/need to do tis by hand. Get a copy of textools, and on previously prepared uv pieces run \"Sort\" (to get all the UV pieces alignes to one of axes, this is important step) and then \"Pack\" or whatever it is called. Remember to:</em><br><em>- turn off any snapping in 3ds max, or you'll end up with weirdly rotated pieces instead of nicely arranged, vertically/horisontally oriented UVs </em><br><em>- have some padding options, you dont want to have zero-pixel distances between the uv islands, it'll cause bleeding and baking issues later.</em><br><br>This is less efficient way and gives a rather random result, but if you'll be using painter to texture it, it doesnt matter that much how logically arranged the UVs are, as you';; be using viewport to texture it anyway.<br><br>Normal UV version, using UV layout:<br>I scale UVs in max, depending on their importance (back/bottom faces are smaller, sights are larger, etc). Such prepared model is going to UV layout (strongly advice getting the \"UV layour bridge\" script for super-fast work between max and UV layout)<br>In uv layout, I make few boxes around parts of certain areas, not beign very precise about it - usually for weapon I like having sights and magazine / ammo somewhere in one part of the texture, rest is scattered around 0-1 UV space.<br>Then, UV layout settings:<br>After aligning the pieces to one of the axes:<br>4k map,quality: best, bleed (padding) 12PX, 10-12MINS, no rotation, show shell bleeds, show tile coverage (very usefull for dick comparing later that you've utilised the UV better than rest of the people), Allow box overlaps, shrink boxes to fit. Rest by default, usually 1 or off.<br>Click pack, go make a coffe, return 10 minutes later, and enjoy having model packed more tightly than you'd ever managed to pack by hand. Or click again and test results, its up to you. For more complex morels, 15 minutes of UV layout work could save me up to 10hours of packing. <br>After everything, click \"send\" if you're using UV bridge, or save the mapped obj and get it back to max.<br><br>When you have the model back in max, run on it a textool function \"Smoothing groups from UV chunks\" - this is to endure that my smoothgroups are still synced with uv islands. Now, into the baking.<br><br><em>The poor mans baking version, using 3ds max:</em><br><em>Note that you wont be getting all the nice maps that substance painter uses, thats the main reason i've started using marmoset baker.</em><br><em>Contrary to popular belief, you can get good normalmaps from 3ds max, it just require some more knowledge and work, that most people dont have or want to pursue. Anyway:</em><br><em>On your lowpoly model, apply \"Turn to poly\" modifier, and limit the edges to 3. This will make your model triangulated, without making any permanent modifications to it. Some edges might be incorrectly placed after that, fix it on edit_poly modifier using \"turn\" option for faces edges.</em><br><em>Apply Projection modifier on top of it, add your HP meshes, reset cage to average all verticles of it, and offset it. Spend some time manually tweaking it (shouldnt take more than 5 minutes) next step.</em><br><em>Render to texture dialog, an old friend for old people. Bake normalmaps there with double the final resolution, to fight crappy filtering (if you start playing with filtering/aa options in render settings, it'll render longer than just double size, so do yourself a favor and save time). You should be able to bake normalmap, AO and colormap ID. Cavity map can be extracted from normalmap in photoshop using xnormal plugin. Note that sometimes you'll need to explode the model to avoig crappy overlaps from misshits of rays. Textools might help you get some additional maps.</em><br><br>Normal baking version, using marmoset toolbag.<br>Very streamlined: click on bread icon, become breadmaster.<br>Export your hp model with some iterations on sub-d (2 is usually enough, 3 if you started with super-lowpoly mesh for sub-d) - this is good moment to apply some colors to HP parts, that will be baked into material ID map, export your lp model.<br>Put highpoly meshes into HIGH group, lowpoly mesh to LOW group, Name the baked maps, tweak skew, tweak offset, select maps you need (for painter you'd want everything, especially thisckness / cavity that you wont get from max. <br>Bake it at 2x desired resolution, shrink them afterward using some sharp interpolation alghoritm.<br><br>And thats it, you have baked mesh. Most of things mentioned here are pretty straightforward, but people still ask about certain steps of creating models, so.<br>",

You have zero experience in 3d modelling, but by extensive handholding you managed to finish it, clicking exactly what tutor clicked and doing exactly tutor in the movie did. </p>\n<p> You learned nothing. Instead of writing a book using your own words, you've just copied the whole thing from someone else, not really learning anything, just followed the guides. Gained very little. Now youre asking where is the inset function. Or why extrude is making weird lines. Or where the selection thingy go, and what its actually named. Or similiar, basic question.</p>\n<p> Learning 3D (not 3d, anything in reality) is lenghty process. It takes months, even years to be reasonably good with it. It is boring process as well, that done the proper way, that will benefit you later. Due to availability of videotutorials and widespread internet access, where everyone can now \"teach\", its very easy to fall into a trap of being fooled about your own skills, by people who dont posses them on a level that'd allow them to evaluate your own. But its fun and fast, and you see results immidiately, so you feel that shot of dopamine. Yet, you learned nothing, just made something, not even unique (just check how many grenades/radios/AKs there is on artstation)</p>\n<p> To avoid mistakes like these, you should take the boring way. Most, if  not all softwares, have quite good help files/manuals, either online or under universal, often ignored F1 key. Most of your questions are answered there, you just need to search them. Here are few links to help docs for certain softwares:</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>3D Studio Max: <a href=\"http://help.autodesk.com/view/3DSMAX/2019/ENU/\">http://help.autodesk.com/view/3DSMAX/2019/ENU/</a></p>\n<p>Maya: <a href=\"https://help.autodesk.com/view/MAYAUL/2019/ENU/\">https://help.autodesk.com/view/MAYAUL/2019/ENU/</a></p>\n<p>Zbrush: <a href=\"http://docs.pixologic.com/\">http://docs.pixologic.com/</a></p>\n<p>Blender: <a href=\"https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/latest/\">https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/latest/</a></p>\n<p>Modo: <a href=\"https://learn.foundry.com/modo/content/help/pages/learn.html\">https://learn.foundry.com/modo/content/help/pages/learn.html</a></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> If youre total beginner with the program, start with reading up the \"getting started / basic / introduction\" etc chapters, where everything is explained in a very simple way. Build your knowledge on top of it. Experiment with every function/tool on some simple shapes until you know what it does. After you go through all the explanatory chapters, and are comfortable with interface and tools available, then pick up a more complex tutorial, never before.</p>\n<p>Good luck.</p>",
