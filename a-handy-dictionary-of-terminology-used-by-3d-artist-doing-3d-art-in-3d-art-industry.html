picking  3d art/ gameart (thanks, 𝓫𝓵𝓮𝓷𝓭𝓮𝓻) as their hobby and/or career path, and I've noticed more and more confusion about all the weird words the 3d dinosaurs throw at newbies - Having this in mind, I've decided to start this article/blogpost, that'll most likely grow in size. I'll try to explain things in layman terms, without getting into any math, but some knowledge or googling on your own will be required, especially after you have some keywords from this list. Starting with terms from last week:</address><h2><strong>#A</strong></h2><p> </p><p>Albedo map - technically, albedo its a ratio of radiation reflected to radiation incident. For CG, all you need to know that albedo map is a map of colors, without any light data - no shadows, no ao, no specular reflections applied onto diffuse.</p><figure><figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy" src="https://propiro.github.io/media/posts/22/ss_2022-12-21-04h56_50_Anonymous.jpg" sizes="(min-width: 1500px) calc(7.87vw + 610px), (min-width: 900px) calc(44.48vw + 68px), (min-width: 780px) calc(8vw + 604px), calc(84.35vw + 23px)" srcset="https://propiro.github.io/media/posts/22/responsive/ss_2022-12-21-04h56_50_Anonymous-xs.jpg 300w, https://propiro.github.io/media/posts/22/responsive/ss_2022-12-21-04h56_50_Anonymous-sm.jpg 480w, https://propiro.github.io/media/posts/22/responsive/ss_2022-12-21-04h56_50_Anonymous-md.jpg 768w" alt="" width="776" height="386"></figure><figcaption>Diffuse map on the left, Albedo map on the right - notice lack of highlights and shadows.

You can either render AO in realtime using various techniques like SSAO, or bake it into a texturemap. </p><figure><figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy" src="https://propiro.github.io/media/posts/22/ss_2022-12-21-04h59_08_Anonymous.jpg" sizes="(min-width: 1500px) calc(7.87vw + 610px), (min-width: 900px) calc(44.48vw + 68px), (min-width: 780px) calc(8vw + 604px), calc(84.35vw + 23px)" srcset="https://propiro.github.io/media/posts/22/responsive/ss_2022-12-21-04h59_08_Anonymous-xs.jpg 300w, https://propiro.github.io/media/posts/22/responsive/ss_2022-12-21-04h59_08_Anonymous-sm.jpg 480w, https://propiro.github.io/media/posts/22/responsive/ss_2022-12-21-04h59_08_Anonymous-md.jpg 768w" alt="" width="2400" height="598"></figure><figcaption>Ambient Occlusion pass used in offline rendered image, multiplied with original image.

Usually stored in single 8bit channel.</p><figure><figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy" src="https://propiro.github.io/media/posts/22/ss_2022-12-21-05h07_42_Anonymous.jpg" sizes="(min-width: 1500px) calc(7.87vw + 610px), (min-width: 900px) calc(44.48vw + 68px), (min-width: 780px) calc(8vw + 604px), calc(84.35vw + 23px)" srcset="https://propiro.github.io/media/posts/22/responsive/ss_2022-12-21-05h07_42_Anonymous-xs.jpg 300w, https://propiro.github.io/media/posts/22/responsive/ss_2022-12-21-05h07_42_Anonymous-sm.jpg 480w, https://propiro.github.io/media/posts/22/responsive/ss_2022-12-21-05h07_42_Anonymous-md.jpg 768w" alt="" width="1015" height="567"></figure><figcaption>Example of baked to map Ambient Occlusion on Bowser character.

Source: 80.lv / Ben Keeling</figcaption></figure><p> </p><h2>#B</h2><p>Banding - an unwanted effect on normalmap (or gradients in general), happening because there is not enough colors to make smooth transition from one color to another. Usually fixed by forcing dithering, or using higher BPP value.</p><p>Baking, baking maps - a process of rendering effects on 2d textures - most commonly used to describe transfering high detail data from highpoly to lowpoly models, as well ambient occlusion, curvature, thickness - there is a lot of map types. You'll often heard people talking about "baking normals", meaning they'll bake geometry normals from highpoly model. If someone say he'll bake some lightmaps, means they'll be baking  light data to map/set of maps to make it more perfomance-wise, without using realtime lighting (Ambient occlusion map is example of light baked into texture - all those nice shadows in corners are pre-rendered, because calculating them on the go is expensive) </p><p>Basecolor - sometimes used instead of Albedo - means the color of a surface, unaffected by light. A core component in PBR rendering/texturing - you want this surface component to represent just the color, without influence of light/shadow/specularity/roughness/ etc etc. If its yellow, its yellow on basecolor, and just because blue light makes it green, changes nothing.  While packing maps for models, usually having _COL prefix at the end.</p><p>Binormal</p><p>Bleeding, color bleeding, mipmap bleeding, light bleeding - a term used to describe texture issue that happens when pixels from one part of the unwrapped mesh influent/mix/blend with pixels on different part - cause either by low resolution, wrong unwrapping, no padding/margin on textures, sometimes by incorrect light baking settings.</p><p>Blender - a device used to blend things.</p><p>Booleans, boolean modelling - modelling technique (often used with dynamesh when describing) based on adding/substracting shapes one from another, rather than modelling the shape from scratch. Most important advantage is timesaving, while disadventage is very messy topology that require cleaning, and not perfect control over topology. Used in constructive solid geometry.</p><p>Brep - acronym for Boundary REPresentation - basically what most people call "cad modelling" - you dont operate on polygons/verticles, but instead you create surfaces using lines/curves, and extrude/boolean them. Look how Fusion360 / Moi3d modelling looks like.</p><p>Bump map - a very general term describing a map that stores information about disortion of surface normals of an object - it could be heighmap, normalmap, displacement map, flow map, parallax map - anything that is stored in a 2d space that influences surface normals of 3d object. Most commonly when someone say "bumpmap" they mean black and white image that makes surface of a model looks "bumpy" or more "noisey" - like a concrete for example, by changing its pixel heigh on texture (it doesnt modify actual geometry).</p><p>BPP - bit per pixel - amound of bits you use to store pixel value, commonly its 8 bits for each channel (so R,G,B takes 24Bits, if you add Alpha channel, RGBA takes 32Bits) to store color information. With normalmaps, its more common to store (at least for work, not finished, engine-ready content) data in 16 BPP space, to fit more informations and prevent banding. Various crunch compression methods (like DXT or ETC for example) reduce amount of bits used. Interesting fact - in DXT compression, more bits go for Green channel (human eyes are better at detecting green colors/hues), and thats the reason lot of studios go with MRA channel packing, having roughness - the most detailed channel - packed onto green channel of map.<br><br><br></p><h2>#C</h2><p>CAD - Acronym for Computer Aided Design, which means every work related to art you do on PC rather than with pen and paper - usually used incorrectly to describe BREP modelling style. </p><p>Chunk, UV Chunk - same as UV island - a separate piece of unwrapped model [resent on UV map, can be one triangle, can be group of triangles/quads/ngons.</p><p>Collada - file format (COLLA borative D esign A ctivity) used as an alternative to FBX to transfer 3d data between compatibile applications, without limitations of OBJ file - It could include skinning, animation, and physic, BREP data and morphs for example, while OBJ only stores polygonal data of models.</p><h2>#D</h2><p>DAE - Digital Asset Exchange format that store data in XML format, look at collada for more thorough description.</p><p>Diffuse map - Map/Texture describing color of the surface, with addition to shading/reflections baked into it - you can merge ambient occlusion pass to fake depth on the model, or highlight corners to give them fake shiny look - sometimes refeered to as an "old workflow" - as it was common to mix lighting data with color data in pre-PBR authoring methods.</p><p>Displacement - technique that makes verticles of mesh change their position according to map/supplied parameter value, making it either higher or lowed from the original surface. Main difference between displacement and normalmapping/parallax mapping / bumpmapping is that actual geometry is changed, instead of just texture pixel data. </p><p>Displacement map - a texture map with pixels representing values for displacement alghoritm, making geometry displace according to UV mapped data. Note that to see any kind of change you need actual geometry there to be displaced, so it works best on high-density meshes (if you map displacement texture to flat, 2 triangle plane, it wont get any displacement, because there is no verticles to displace except 4 corner ones) </p><p>Dithering - a technique of using noise to hide banding / color changes on gradients, or blending phases with alpha - with high enough resolutions, making certain patterns of noise pixels, its possible to cheat eyes/brain into thinking that color transition is smooth, while its not.   </p><p>Dynamesh - Originally Zbrush technique often used in pair with boolean modelling, that makes a dense, more-or-less even topology on source geometry, allowing user to sculpt on that model with ease. While used with "Boolean-Dynamesh" technique, usually means making dense topology on model, so it can be easily smoothed on corners, making it suitable for baking maps to lowpoly.</p><h2>#E</h2><p>Edge - a line between two points. Three edges (actually two, but you want to avoid it as its considered a bug/issue) or more are required to make a closed surface that can be shaded.</p><p>Edge Flow - a general term used to describe "smooth/unbroken" way across edges on model.</p><h2>#F</h2><p>Fbx - fileformat commonly used in 3d industry, Shortcut for FilmBox. Favoured for ability to transfer lot of additional informations alongside geometry, like lights, cameras, some modificators (like turbosmooth or skin) between applications and engines.</p><p>Flowmap</p><h2>#G</h2><h2>#H</h2><p>Hard Edge</p><p>Heightmap</p><h2>#I</h2><p>Interpolation</p><h2>#J</h2><p>Jitter</p><p>Joint Surfaces</p><h2>#K</h2><h2>#L</h2><p>Lightmap - sometimes called AO map or ambient map - a map that contains lighting information, usually stored inside 8Bit color space (so, a single gray channel), unless you need something like Directional normal map.</p><p>Lookdev</p><h2>#M</h2><p>Max - Autodesk 3d studio max, modelling package, favoured mostly by modellers. </p><p>Maya - Autodesk Maya, modelling package, favoured mostly by animators.</p><p>Megascans, quixel megascans - colloquial name for photoscanned assets, available on Epics Megascan store - usually environmental, very realistic and very heavy in terms of geometry 3d models that werent modelled by hand, but "generated" from lots of 2d photos, using technique called photogrammetry (some assets are scanned using different ways, but thats another tale).</p><p>Metalness, metallic - property of surface defining how conductive it is - while it should be either 0 or 1 (black or white, not grayscale) - as things are either conductive or dielectric (non-conductive), things like dirt or rust tend to be represented by grayscale values, which often cause problems in realtime engines, like unity or unreal (without help of clipping values to 0/1).</p><p>Metalness map - a map that stores metal value of mapped surface, 0 beign non-metallic, white beign metallic. Used in PBR rendering, tied to IOR / Index of Refraction known from offline-renderers. Usually stored as component alongside other maps in RMA/MRA, or separately as 8bit grayscale, commonly using _MET suffix in name.</p><h2>#N</h2><p>Node, node-based</p><p>Normal - in geometry, normal describes vector (line) thats perpendicular to given object type. For a face/quad/triangle/vertex, it'll be a line that shows facing direction of surface. Theyre extremaly important when it comes to shading models, and baking normalmaps. </p><figure><figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy" src="https://propiro.github.io/media/posts/22/ss_2022-12-21-04h36_52_Anonymous.jpg" sizes="(min-width: 1500px) calc(7.87vw + 610px), (min-width: 900px) calc(44.48vw + 68px), (min-width: 780px) calc(8vw + 604px), calc(84.35vw + 23px)" srcset="https://propiro.github.io/media/posts/22/responsive/ss_2022-12-21-04h36_52_Anonymous-xs.jpg 300w, https://propiro.github.io/media/posts/22/responsive/ss_2022-12-21-04h36_52_Anonymous-sm.jpg 480w, https://propiro.github.io/media/posts/22/responsive/ss_2022-12-21-04h36_52_Anonymous-md.jpg 768w" alt="normals" width="1396" height="563"></figure><figcaption>Blue arrows represent normal direction of each quad on this curved surface. Source: Wikipedia</figcaption></figure><p> </p><p>Normalmap</p><h2>#O</h2><p>Obj - Wavefront  Object file format - very popular in open source softwares, able to store simple geometry and material IDs inside. Materials itself are usually stored in MTL file thats exported/generated alongside it.</p><p>Offline Rendering - rarely heard term, describing anything that is NOT realtime - if you need to press f9 and wait 10 minutes for one frame to render, you can consider it offline rendering (unless you play game at 0.01 FPS, then... then its just very slow) - usually outputs of offline renderings are used later, be it as a source material/ingrdient of realtime-application, or part of a movie that will be played in 60frames per second, even if rendering it took 2 months.</p><h2>#P</h2><p>Packmap, packed map - term used for a map that is composed of various sub-maps describing different things (so technically normalmap is packmap as well), usually multiple 8 bit channels with data into one 24/32 bit image, which while might look odd, stores valuable informations for engine/renderer. A most common example would be RMA / MRA map - RMA means [R]oughness, [M]etalness, [A]mbient data separated to channels of texture - Red, Green, Blue (and alpha if used). MRA is [M]etalness, [R]oughness, [A]mbient - different order of data, there is a reason for storing Roughness on green, but its too technical, so maybe another time (its about how DXT textures are compressing channels)</p><figure><figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy" src="https://propiro.github.io/media/posts/22/ss_2022-12-21-05h16_57_Anonymous.jpg" sizes="(min-width: 1500px) calc(7.87vw + 610px), (min-width: 900px) calc(44.48vw + 68px), (min-width: 780px) calc(8vw + 604px), calc(84.35vw + 23px)" srcset="https://propiro.github.io/media/posts/22/responsive/ss_2022-12-21-05h16_57_Anonymous-xs.jpg 300w, https://propiro.github.io/media/posts/22/responsive/ss_2022-12-21-05h16_57_Anonymous-sm.jpg 480w, https://propiro.github.io/media/posts/22/responsive/ss_2022-12-21-05h16_57_Anonymous-md.jpg 768w" alt="" width="438" height="575"></figure><figcaption>Example of RMA map split into separate channels representing Roughness, Metalness, Ambient occlusion. Source: Autodesk.com</figcaption></figure><p> </p><p>Padding - texture padding, margin, uv margin - a distance between uv chunks on UV map, maintained to prevent texture bleeds from one pixel group to another one on UV pieces that are too close to each other. Pixel data is usually generated automatically when baking or exporting textures, according to given value in software of choice.

Changes in your viewport can be also called beign realtime - unless you start pre-rendering parts of your models, like ambienc occlusion or simulating particles. </p><p>Roughness - term defining how "rough" a surface is, usually used to describe how well it reflects light. 0/black color on roughness map - rough surface (like concrete) will be worse reflector than smooth surface (1.0/255/white on map, like glass) - its very simplified example though, as it affects how light is diffused on surface, more rough means less reflected light.</p><p>Roughness map - a map that stores roughness information, usually in 8bit space. Either component of RMA / MRA map on dedicated channel, or saved as grayscale, 8bit map with suffix of _RGS</p><h2>#S</h2><p>Smoothgroups - Autodesk 3ds max specific term for mesh normals, by splitting/unifying smoothgroups you affect vertex normals and create smooth/sharp transition between surfaces.</p><p>Smoothness - Same as roughness, but values are inverted - the more white / the higher value, then surface is more smooth, hence diffusing less light and reflecting more.</p><p>SSS - Sub Surface Scattering - Sometimes called subsurface light transport (SSLT) - Technique used to represent things that are partially transparent/partially absorbing light, like skin or wax - light doesn't reflect through them completely, but instead lit up to certain depth.</p><p>Subdivision Modelling, Sub-d - High poly modelling technique that rely on using subdivision alghoritms - basically, dividing each quad (...its important that model is in quads, not triangles/ngons, at least on non-flat surfaces), and averaging the normals. By dividing and averaging quads, rounded surfaces can be created, which are perfect for high poly models that are then baked onto lowpoly.</p><figure><figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy" src="https://propiro.github.io/media/posts/22/ss_2022-12-21-05h24_30_Anonymous.jpg" sizes="(min-width: 1500px) calc(7.87vw + 610px), (min-width: 900px) calc(44.48vw + 68px), (min-width: 780px) calc(8vw + 604px), calc(84.35vw + 23px)" srcset="https://propiro.github.io/media/posts/22/responsive/ss_2022-12-21-05h24_30_Anonymous-xs.jpg 300w, https://propiro.github.io/media/posts/22/responsive/ss_2022-12-21-05h24_30_Anonymous-sm.jpg 480w, https://propiro.github.io/media/posts/22/responsive/ss_2022-12-21-05h24_30_Anonymous-md.jpg 768w" alt="" width="3581" height="1254"></figure><figcaption>Examples of geometry prepared using sub-d modelling- First is unsubdivided geometry, second is subdivided, third is subdivided, then collapsed to geometry - Notice how geometry corners are protected with edges.
